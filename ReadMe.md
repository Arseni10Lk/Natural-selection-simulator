# Natural selection simulator #

Some ideas were taken from [the Primer's video on natural selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM). However, this project is planned to include more mechanics while also to have lower quality of visualisation (at least absence of 3D graphics).

As of now the code only sets all the initial conditions to start.
At first visualisations will be made using `matplotlib` library, later it is planned to move to `pygame` while leaving matplotlib for statistics of the simulation.

To be updated... (To add: description of the desired features to be implemented in the future)
